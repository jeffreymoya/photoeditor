# Implementation Preflight Checklist

Use this checklist before implementation or review work so every agent leans on the same sources.

1. Read `standards/standards-governance-ssot.md` for the current rules and change process.
2. Evaluate task complexity once using `standards/task-breakdown-canon.md`.
3. Determine applicable tier guidance via `standards/AGENTS.md`, then consult the cited tier docs alongside `standards/cross-cutting.md` and `standards/typescript.md`.
4. Review every ADR referenced in the task file to ensure you are honoring historical decisions.
