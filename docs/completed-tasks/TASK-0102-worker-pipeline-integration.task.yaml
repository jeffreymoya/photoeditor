title: "Cover worker pipeline with deterministic integration tests"
status: completed
priority: P1
complexity: M
area: backend

description: >-
  Requirements mandate that uploaded images are optimized, analyzed by Gemini, edited by Seedream,
  and finalized in S3 with user notifications, but we currently have no automated evidence that the
  shared-core-powered worker Lambda orchestrates these steps correctly after the BFF refactor. Build
  integration tests that invoke the worker handler with realistic S3/SQS payloads, stub external
  providers, and assert that job status transitions, S3 writes, and notification calls occur as
  expected without network access while keeping the worker decoupled from Nest.

outcome: >-
  Deterministic integration tests in backend/tests/integration exercise the worker Lambda (under
  `backend/workers`) from SQS event through final S3 upload, proving the shared factory wiring,
  Gemini and Seedream interactions (via stubs), fallback copy behavior, and SNS notifications
  outlined in docs/requirements.md.

    - Mobile app notification handling
    - Direct SDK imports in handlers (STANDARDS.md hard fail - handlers → services → adapters only)
    - VPC configuration for API Lambdas (workers may be in VPC with ADR; STANDARDS.md line 127)
    - Breaking changes to shared-core interfaces without versioning and migration guide
    - Manual-only tests; all tests must run in CI (testing-standards.md)
    - Testing implementation details vs. behavior; focus on contract compliance

  coding_guidelines:
    - Stub Gemini and Seedream providers per docs/testing-standards.md; no live HTTP calls.
    - Control timers and randomness for deterministic assertions.
    - Handlers must remain ≤50 LOC with cyclomatic complexity ≤5 (STANDARDS.md hard fail >10).
    - No handler imports @aws-sdk/* or DB clients; obtain via adapter factories (STANDARDS.md hard fail).
    - All services/adapters use DI; no 'new' of SDK/DB clients in business logic (STANDARDS.md hard fail).
    - Emit structured JSON logs with correlationId, traceId, requestId, jobId per Powertools (STANDARDS.md).
    - "Follow layers: handlers \u2192 services \u2192 adapters; no lateral imports (STANDARDS.md dependency policy)."
  prohibited:
    - Do not modify provider production endpoints or secrets.
    - Do not rely on sequential test order.
    - No direct SDK/database client imports in handlers or services.
    - No breaking changes to shared-core interfaces without versioning and ADR.
    - No VPC configuration for API Lambdas (workers may be in VPC when required with ADR).

acceptance_criteria:
  # Core Integration Coverage
  - Worker integration tests assert optimized S3 uploads, Gemini analysis stub invocations, Seedream edit stub usage, and final S3 object writes while going through the shared-core factories.
  - Tests cover both success path and fallback copy when Seedream returns an error, confirming final job completion and notification call.
  - Batch job progress and SNS notification behaviors are verified with controlled mocks.
  - Tests reset state, control time/uuid, and avoid external network per docs/testing-standards.md; runs are non-flaky.

  # Testability (STANDARDS.md lines 95-104)
  - Service layer achieves ≥80% line coverage and ≥70% branch coverage (STANDARDS.md requirement).
  - Adapter layer achieves ≥80% line coverage and ≥70% branch coverage (STANDARDS.md requirement).
  - Mutation testing score ≥60% for services and adapters (STANDARDS.md requirement).
  - Contract tests validate stubs against shared schemas from @photoeditor/shared.
  - Idempotency tests demonstrate workers handle duplicate SQS messages correctly.

  # Hard Fail Prevention (STANDARDS.md lines 30-44)
  - No handler imports @aws-sdk/* or database clients (verified by grep in validation).
  - Worker handler remains ≤50 LOC with cyclomatic complexity ≤5 (lint enforced, hard fail >10).
  - All services/adapters obtain clients via DI/factory pattern; no 'new' of SDK clients.
  - Structured JSON logs emit correlationId, traceId, requestId, jobId using Powertools.
  - Dependency graph validates handlers → services → adapters layering; no cycles detected.

  # Modifiability (STANDARDS.md lines 86-92)
  - Test changes confined to test files; no production code changes beyond test seams.
  - Provider stubs align with existing contract tests; no schema drift.

  manual_checks:
    - Review captured stub logs to ensure no unintended provider calls leak through real network.
    - Verify test output shows correlationId in all log entries.

risks:
  - description: Complex stubbing could diverge from real provider contracts.
    mitigation: Use shared schema types from @photoeditor/shared and align stub payloads with existing contract tests.
  - description: Handler complexity may exceed ≤50 LOC or CC ≤5 if too much test setup logic added.
    mitigation: Keep handler minimal; move test orchestration to helper factories. Enforce with lint rules (hard fail >10 CC).
  - description: Test doubles may not exercise DI/factory patterns correctly, masking production wiring issues.
    mitigation: Integration tests must import actual handler.ts and factory.ts; stub only at adapter boundaries (S3Client, SNSClient).
  - description: Missing DLQ validation could allow messages to be lost in production.
    mitigation: Verify DLQ configuration in IaC; add integration test simulating retry exhaustion and DLQ delivery (STANDARDS.md line 121).
  - description: Flaky tests from uncontrolled async timing or shared state.
    mitigation: Mock timers (jest.useFakeTimers), control UUIDs (jest.mock('uuid')), reset all mocks in beforeEach; enforce flake-rate <1% (STANDARDS.md line 104).
  - description: Coverage thresholds may not catch untested error branches.
    mitigation: Use mutation testing (≥60% kill rate) to validate branch coverage quality; review mutation survivors in PR (STANDARDS.md line 100).
