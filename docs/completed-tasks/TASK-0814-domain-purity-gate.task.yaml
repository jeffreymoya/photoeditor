title: "Enforce backend domain Result purity gate"
status: completed
priority: P1
area: backend
blocked_by: []
depends_on: []

description: >-
  Build an automated fitness function that scans backend domain modules to ensure exported
  functions return neverthrow Result/ResultAsync types, avoid throwing exceptions, and do
  not import infrastructure libraries. Surface violations during QA and emit an evidence
  report for the bundle so domain purity regressions fail fast per backend standards.

outcome: >-
  `pnpm --filter @photoeditor/backend run qa:static` fails when domain modules violate purity
  rules, and `docs/evidence/domain-purity.json` captures pass/fail details for the release
  evidence bundle.

scope:
  in:
    - scripts/ci/check-domain-purity.mjs
    - backend/package.json (qa:static hook)
    - scripts/evidence-bundle (run check during evidence collection)
    - docs/evidence/domain-purity.json
  out:
    - Non-backend domain directories (mobile/shared)
    - Broader dependency graph enforcement beyond specified purity rules

    title: Catalogue domain purity heuristics
    details: >-
      Inspect backend/src/domain exports against standards/backend-tier.md#domain-service-layer purity
      rules and standards/typescript.md#3-analyzability guidance on `Result`/`ResultAsync` usage;
      record enforced heuristics in docs/evidence/domain-purity.md for reviewer traceability.

    title: Implement AST-based purity checker
    details: >-
      Build scripts/ci/check-domain-purity.mjs to fail when domain exports violate standards/backend-tier.md#domain-service-layer
      purity boundaries or standards/typescript.md#language--api-surface-rules ban on exception control flow; ensure the tool emits
      machine-readable findings per docs/evidence/domain-purity.md.

    outputs:

    definition_of_done:
      - scripts/ci/check-domain-purity.mjs flags non-Result returns and forbidden imports per standards/backend-tier.md#domain-service-layer, with unit fixtures documented in docs/evidence/domain-purity.md.

    title: Wire checker into QA and evidence bundle
    details: >-
      Integrate the checker into backend/package.json and scripts/evidence-bundle so `qa:static` enforces standards/testing-standards.md#required-commands-before-pr
      and evidence capture satisfies standards/testing-standards.md#evidence-expectations.

    inputs:

      - docs/evidence/domain-purity.md
    outputs:
      - backend/package.json
      - scripts/evidence-bundle
    definition_of_done:
      - backend/package.json invokes the checker inside `qa:static`, and scripts/evidence-bundle copies docs/evidence/domain-purity.json, aligning with standards/testing-standards.md#required-commands-before-pr and standards/testing-standards.md#evidence-expectations.

    title: Validate failure/success scenarios
    details: >-
      Exercise the checker on clean and intentionally broken samples, capturing artefacts required by standards/testing-standards.md#evidence-expectations
      and cross-cutting hard-fail controls in standards/cross-cutting.md#hard-fail-controls.
    actor: agent
    inputs:
      - scripts/ci/check-domain-purity.mjs
    outputs:
      - docs/evidence/domain-purity.json
    definition_of_done:
      - docs/evidence/domain-purity.json records both passing and failing runs with references to standards/testing-standards.md#evidence-expectations, and the checker exit code proves compliance with standards/cross-cutting.md#hard-fail-controls.
    estimate: S
    expected_files_touched:
      - docs/evidence/domain-purity.json

acceptance_criteria:
  must:
    - Checker fails with actionable output when an exported domain function lacks Result/ResultAsync return type.
    - Checker fails when domain files import @aws-sdk/* or contain throw statements.
    - Successful run writes docs/evidence/domain-purity.json summarizing results and passes in CI.
    - Evidence bundle script invokes the checker and includes the JSON artifact.
  quality_gates:
    - "Handler LOC/complexity within budgets per standards/cross-cutting.md"
    - "Service/Adapter LOC/complexity within budgets per standards/cross-cutting.md"
    - "No cross-layer imports (dependency-cruiser enforced)"
    - "Coverage thresholds per standards/testing-standards.md"
    - "Contract tests pass for all routes"

validation:
  manual_checks:
    - Open docs/evidence/domain-purity.json and confirm summary + zero violations when code is clean.
  artifacts:
    - docs/evidence/domain-purity.json

deliverables:
  - scripts/ci/check-domain-purity.mjs
  - backend/package.json
  - scripts/evidence-bundle
  - docs/evidence/domain-purity.json

risks:
  - description: False positives if domain modules intentionally expose non-Result helpers.
    mitigation: Allow opt-out by limiting scan to backend/src/domain and documenting helper relocation needs.
