title: "Implement RTK Query and XState for job/upload state"
status: completed
priority: P1
area: mobile
unblocker: false
order: 5
blocked_by: [TASK-0818, TASK-0820]

description: >-
  Add RTK Query slices for API calls and XState state machines for job lifecycle per
  standards/frontend-tier.md#state--logic-layer. Export .scxml or Mermaid diagrams, ensure
  pure selectors, and generate fitness evidence (complexity reports, statechart checksums).

outcome: >-
  RTK Query manages all network state, XState charts control job/upload lifecycle, pure selectors
  verified, statechart artifacts stored in docs/ui/state-metrics, and reducer complexity ≤10.

    title: Create RTK Query API slices
    details: >-
      Define RTK Query API slices for job operations (presign, status, download) per
      standards/frontend-tier.md#state--logic-layer. Use port interfaces for API calls.
      Ensure idempotency keys for upload operations.

    definition_of_done:
      - RTK Query slices created for job/upload operations
      - API calls use port interfaces (no direct fetch)
      - Idempotency keys implemented for uploads

    title: Implement XState job lifecycle machine
    details: >-
      Create or update XState state machine for job/upload lifecycle with pure guards/conditions

    definition_of_done:
      - XState machine models job lifecycle (idle → uploading → processing → complete/error)
      - Guards and conditions are pure predicates (no side effects)
      - Context updates via assign() with pure updaters
      - .scxml or Mermaid diagram exported to docs/ui/state-metrics
