description: >-
  Create an authoritative environment registry that captures SST and Terraform outputs
  per stage (dev, stage, prod), ties
  them to deployment timestamps, and stores evidence for audit. Standards/infrastructure-tier.md
  requires this registry to
  prove configuration drift is controlled.

outcome: >-
  A versioned registry document or automation populates environment metadata for each
  stage, persists it under docs/infra,
  and integrates with validation workflows so auditors can trace resource identifiers
  and their provenance.

scope:
  in:
  - scripts or automation that collect outputs from SST and Terraform
  - docs/infra/environment-registry.md (or generated JSON)
  - Updates to validation workflow notes referencing the registry
  out:
  - Changes to resource provisioning (handled in other tasks)
  - Secrets or runtime credentials (store references only)

constraints:

  coding_guidelines:
  - Prefer automation over manual tables; registry should be reproducible.
  - Include timestamps and source commands for each entry.
  prohibited:
  - Do not store secrets or access keys; reference Secret Manager/SSM 
    identifiers instead.

  title: Define registry schema and data sources
  details: >-
    Derive required fields (stage, stack, outputs, timestamps) from standards/infrastructure-tier.md#infrastructure-tier
    and
    governance expectations in standards/cross-cutting.md#governance--knowledge; document
    schema decisions in docs/infra/environment-registry.md.

  inputs:
  - standards/infrastructure-tier.md
  - standards/cross-cutting.md
  - docs/infra/terraform-control-plane-evidence.md
  outputs:
  - docs/infra/environment-registry.md
  definition_of_done:
  - docs/infra/environment-registry.md lists schema fields with citations to 
    standards/infrastructure-tier.md#infrastructure-tier and 
    standards/cross-cutting.md#governance--knowledge.

  title: Implement data collection script or workflow
  details: >-
    Author scripts/infra/export-environment-registry.ts to gather SST/Terraform outputs
    and emit the schema, ensuring strict typing per standards/typescript.md#language--api-surface-rules.
  actor: agent
  inputs:
  - scripts
  - infra/sst
  - infrastructure
  - docs/infra/environment-registry.md
  - standards/typescript.md
  outputs:
  - scripts/infra/export-environment-registry.ts
  - docs/infra/environment-registry.md
  definition_of_done:
  - Script produces JSON matching the schema without manual edits, includes 
    inline references to standards/infrastructure-tier.md#infrastructure-tier, 
    and passes strict type checks recorded in 
    docs/infra/environment-registry.md.

  title: Publish registry artifact and documentation
  details: >-
    Commit generated registry under docs/infra and describe refresh cadence plus audit
    usage referencing standards/cross-cutting.md#governance--knowledge and standards/testing-standards.md#evidence-expectations.
  actor: agent
  inputs:

  outputs:

  title: Wire registry into validation workflow
  details: >-
    Update validation docs and agent playbooks to reference the registry so audits
    enforce standards/infrastructure-tier.md#infrastructure-tier without relaxing
    guardrails.
  actor: agent
  inputs:
  - docs/infra/environment-registry.md
  - .claude/agents/test-validation-backend.md
  - .claude/agents/test-validation-mobile.md

  - .claude/agents/test-validation-backend.md
  - .claude/agents/test-validation-mobile.md
  - .claude/agents/test-validation-shared.md
  definition_of_done:
  - Each validation doc references docs/infra/environment-registry.json and 
    cites standards/infrastructure-tier.md#infrastructure-tier plus 
    standards/cross-cutting.md#governance--knowledge; guardrail statements 
    remain intact.
  estimate: S
  expected_files_touched:

acceptance_criteria:
  must:
  - Environment registry artifact includes dev/stage/prod entries with stack 
    names, key outputs, and last-validated dates.
  - Documentation explains update cadence and references 
    standards/infrastructure-tier.md evidence requirements.
  - Validation docs/agents reference the registry without relaxing test or 
    TypeScript guardrails.
  - Registry generation script runs via `pnpm` script with documentation.
  quality_gates:
  - Affected standards references remain satisfied; note any deviations and link
    the follow-up standards change request.
  - No lint/type errors in affected packages.

artifacts:
- path: docs/infra/environment-registry.json
  description: Machine-readable registry of environment outputs per stage.
- path: docs/infra/environment-registry.md
  description: Human-readable registry documentation and refresh procedure.

deliverables:
- scripts/infra/export-environment-registry.ts
- docs/infra/environment-registry.json
- docs/infra/environment-registry.md
- Updated validation agent documentation referencing the registry

risks:
- description: Registry could drift if automation fails or outputs change 
    unexpectedly.
  mitigation: Integrate registry generation into CI and add monitoring for stale
    timestamps.
