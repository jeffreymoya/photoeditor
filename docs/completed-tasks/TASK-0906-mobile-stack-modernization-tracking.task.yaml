description: >-
  This tracking task references docs/proposals/mobile-stack-modernization.md and coordinates
  the phased modernization of the mobile stack from Expo 51 / React Native 0.74.5
  to Expo SDK 53
  (React Native 0.79) with New Architecture enabled by default. The proposal outlines
  six upgrade
  pillars (platform parity, navigation, styling, list performance, camera/background
  work, and
  supply-chain security) delivered across five phases (P0-P4). This task owns the
  ADR creation,
  tracks overall initiative progress, and serves as the reference point for downstream
  implementation tasks.

outcome: >-
  ADR created in adr/ that documents the mobile stack modernization decision, referencing
  the proposal
  and linking to all implementation tasks (TASK-0907 through TASK-0911). Tracking
  artifacts updated
  as each phase completes. All phases transition through their lifecycle and reach
  completed status.

scope:
  in:
  - Creating ADR that references docs/proposals/mobile-stack-modernization.md
  - Tracking completion status of TASK-0907 (SDK 53), TASK-0908 (Expo Router), 
    TASK-0909 (NativeWind/Tamagui), TASK-0910 (FlashList), TASK-0911 
    (VisionCamera)
  - Documenting rollback procedures and success metrics
  - Updating docs/mobile/ with modernization outcomes
  out:
  - Actual implementation work (delegated to phase-specific tasks)
  - Toolchain installation or CI image changes (owned by TASK-0907)
  - Component/library migrations (owned by phase tasks)

  title: Review proposal and clarify open questions
  details: >-
    Read docs/proposals/mobile-stack-modernization.md, identify gaps or ambiguities,
    and document clarifications in evidence file. Confirm timeline, rollback strategy,
    and success metrics with stakeholder (solo maintainer context).

  title: Create ADR for mobile stack modernization
  details: >-
    Author an ADR following standards/global.md ADR format. Reference the proposal,
    explain the decision context (ecosystem shift to New Architecture, SDK 53 defaults,
    security posture), and link to implementation tasks TASK-0907 through TASK-0911.

  title: Document tracking procedures
  details: >-
    Update docs/mobile/ with tracking procedures, rollback strategy, and success metrics.
    Ensure standards/frontend-tier.md alignment for any new conventions introduced
    by the modernization.

validation:
  pipeline:
  - command: "echo 'Documentation task - no code validation required'"
    description: "Tracking task validation placeholder"
  manual_checks:
  - Verify ADR references all implementation tasks (TASK-0907 through TASK-0911)
  - Confirm clarifications file resolves all outstanding questions
  - Ensure tracking document includes rollback procedures and success metrics
  - Validate all links and references in ADR and docs are correct

acceptance_criteria:
  must:
  - ADR exists in adr/ and references 
    docs/proposals/mobile-stack-modernization.md
  - ADR links to all five implementation tasks (TASK-0907, TASK-0908, TASK-0909,
    TASK-0910, TASK-0911)
  - Clarifications file exists at 
    docs/evidence/tasks/TASK-0906-clarifications.md
  - Tracking document exists in docs/mobile/ with rollback strategy and success 
    metrics
  quality_gates:
  - All references and links in ADR are valid
  - No implementation work performed (delegated to phase tasks)

risks:
- description: Phase tasks may uncover requirements not captured in proposal
  mitigation: Iterate ADR and tracking docs as phases progress; update proposal 
    if needed
- description: Timeline may shift based on SDK 53 migration complexity
  mitigation: Track actual vs. estimated timelines; adjust downstream phase 
    priorities
