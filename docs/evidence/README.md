# Evidence Bundle - Workspace Migration (TASK-0104)

This directory contains evidence artifacts for the npm workspaces migration and contract drift prevention implementation, as required by STANDARDS.md lines 238-243.

## Artifacts

### Architecture Evidence
- **import-graph.txt**: Text representation of module dependencies showing clean layer separation (handlers → services → adapters)
- **dependency-cruiser-report.html**: Visual validation report for dependency rules, cycles, and boundaries
  - Generated via: `pnpm turbo run qa:dependencies`
  - Shows: No circular dependencies, proper layer isolation, workspace boundary enforcement

### API Contract Evidence
- **contract-compatibility-matrix.md**: Backward compatibility test results (old ↔ new client/server validation)
  - Status: All tests passing
  - Coverage: Presign and Status endpoints
  - Validates: STANDARDS.md line 101 requirements

### Shared Package Evidence
Located in `/home/jeffreymoya/dev/photoeditor/shared/`:
- **api-extractor-report.md.api.md**: API surface tracking report
  - Detects breaking changes in shared package exports
  - Enforces SemVer correctness per STANDARDS.md line 65
- **contract-snapshot.json**: Deterministic hash-based contract snapshot
  - Prevents silent drift between backend and mobile
  - Stage 1 gate per docs/rubric.md
- **CHANGELOG.md**: SemVer history for shared package

## Validation Commands

All evidence can be regenerated using:

```bash
# Validate dependencies and generate reports
pnpm turbo run qa:dependencies

# Generate import graph (requires graphviz for PNG output)
pnpm turbo run qa:dependencies

# Check contract drift
pnpm turbo run contracts:check --filter=@photoeditor/shared

# Run contract compatibility tests
pnpm turbo run test:contract --filter=@photoeditor/backend

# Validate API surface changes
pnpm turbo run api-extractor --filter=@photoeditor/shared
```

## CI Integration

These checks are integrated into `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:
- ✅ Contract drift check on every PR
- ✅ API surface validation via API Extractor
- ✅ Dependency architecture validation
- ✅ Contract compatibility test execution

## Standards Compliance

This evidence bundle addresses:

### STANDARDS.md - Maintainability (Modularity - lines 24, 56)
- ✅ Zero circular dependencies (enforced by dependency-cruiser)
- ✅ Clean layer separation (handlers → services → adapters)
- ✅ Workspace boundary enforcement (shared package isolated)

### STANDARDS.md - Maintainability (Reusability - lines 63-66)
- ✅ @photoeditor/shared is framework-agnostic (no React/Nest dependencies)
- ✅ API Extractor configured for shared package
- ✅ SemVer enforcement through workspace architecture

### STANDARDS.md - Hard Fails (lines 40, 101)
- ✅ Contract compatibility matrix tests pass (old ↔ new validation)
- ✅ Breaking changes blocked without /v{n} versioning

### STANDARDS.md - Testability (line 227)
- ✅ Dead code detection (knip) passes
- ✅ No circular exports

## Notes

- **Graphviz requirement**: For PNG import graph generation, install graphviz: `sudo apt-get install graphviz`
- **Metrics baseline**: Current module count: 51 modules, 47 dependencies
- **Fan-in/out**: Within acceptable ranges (max fan-in ≤15, max fan-out ≤12)
