## Changes Made to Align Integration Test Documentation

### 1. Updated Integration Tests Section (lines 64-86)

Changed from:
```yaml
### Integration Tests
**From STANDARDS.md lines 46, 54**: Idempotency and DLQ redrive required

Required coverage:
- SQS worker idempotency (duplicate message handling)
- DLQ redrive drills (automated tests each release)
- End-to-end job flow (API → S3 → Queue → Worker → DynamoDB)

Evidence:
```yaml
deliverables:
  - path: docs/evidence/dlq-redrive/runbook.md
  - path: docs/evidence/dlq-redrive/screenshots/
```

Changed to:
```yaml
### Integration Tests
**From STANDARDS.md lines 102-103, 121**: Idempotency, DLQ redrive, and E2E job lifecycle required

Required coverage:
- SQS worker idempotency (duplicate message handling)
- DLQ redrive drills (automated tests each release - STANDARDS.md line 121)
- End-to-end job flow (API → S3 → Queue → Worker → DynamoDB)
- Contract compatibility (old clients vs new server - STANDARDS.md line 101)

Validation:
```yaml
validation:
  commands:
    - npm run test:integration --prefix backend
```

Evidence:
```yaml
deliverables:
  - path: docs/evidence/dlq-redrive/runbook.md
  - path: docs/evidence/dlq-redrive/screenshots/
  - path: docs/evidence/integration-tests/worker-pipeline.log
```

### 2. Added Test Command Reference Section (lines 310-326)

Added new section:
```markdown
## Test Command Reference

### Backend Integration Tests

Use the canonical command:
```bash
npm run test:integration --prefix backend
```

This command:
- Sets `ALLOW_LOCALHOST=true` for LocalStack testing
- Runs integration tests in `backend/tests/integration/`
- Validates end-to-end flows with AWS service mocks
- Verifies idempotency and DLQ behavior (STANDARDS.md line 121)

**Note**: The legacy pattern `npm run test --prefix backend tests/integration` is deprecated. All documentation and tasks should reference `npm run test:integration` for consistency and to leverage the proper environment configuration.
```

### 3. Updated References Section (lines 327-333)

Changed from:
```markdown
## References
- STANDARDS.md lines 7-13: Hard Fail Controls
- STANDARDS.md lines 44-51: Testability requirements
- STANDARDS.md lines 126-132: Evidence Requirements
- STANDARDS.md lines 134-140: PR Gatekeepers (test-related blocks)
```

Changed to:
```markdown
## References
- STANDARDS.md lines 7-13: Hard Fail Controls
- STANDARDS.md lines 44-51: Testability requirements
- STANDARDS.md lines 94-105: Testability (Coverage, Mutation, Contract Compatibility, Idempotency, E2E)
- STANDARDS.md lines 121: DLQ redrive drill requirement
- STANDARDS.md lines 216-233: PR Gates (enforced)
- STANDARDS.md lines 236-244: Evidence Requirements
```

### Summary of Changes

1. **Added canonical command**: `npm run test:integration --prefix backend`
2. **Enhanced STANDARDS.md cross-references**: Added more specific line references (102-103, 121, 101)
3. **Added migration rationale**: Documented why the legacy pattern is deprecated
4. **Added validation command**: Included the integration test command in the validation section
5. **Enhanced evidence artifacts**: Added integration test log deliverable
6. **Improved references**: Added more specific STANDARDS.md line numbers for testability, DLQ, PR gates, and evidence requirements
