# Import Graph Placeholder
# 
# This file serves as a placeholder for the import graph visualization.
# The actual import graph should be generated using:
#   pnpm turbo run qa:dependencies
#
# This command runs:
#   dependency-cruiser backend/src shared mobile/src --config tooling/dependency-rules.json --output-type dot | dot -T png > docs/evidence/import-graph.png
#
# The graph will show:
# - Fan-in and fan-out metrics for each module
# - Dependency relationships across tiers
# - Validation against standards/cross-cutting.md L15:
#   - Fan-in ≤15 (warn at 80%)
#   - Fan-out ≤12 (warn at 80%)
#
# Standards Reference: standards/cross-cutting.md L15
