# Cockatiel Resilience Policy Report

**Task**: TASK-0287 - Adopt cockatiel resilience policies for AI providers
**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Completed

## Overview

This report documents the implementation and validation of resilience policies for provider adapters in the PhotoEditor backend. The implementation provides retry, timeout, circuit breaker, and bulkhead policies configured via shared contracts.

## Policy Settings

### Default Resilience Configuration

The default resilience policy configuration is defined in `/home/jeffreymoya/dev/photoeditor/backend/src/libs/core/providers/resilience-policy.ts`:

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_RESILIENCE_CONFIG: ResiliencePolicyConfig = {
  retry: {
    maxAttempts: 3,
    backoff: 'exponential',
    initialDelayMs: 1000,
    maxDelayMs: 30000
  },
  timeout: {
    durationMs: 30000
  },
  circuitBreaker: {
    enabled: true,
    failureThreshold: 5,
    halfOpenAfterMs: 30000,
    successThreshold: 2
  },
  bulkhead: {
    enabled: false,
    maxConcurrent: 10,
    maxQueued: 100
  }
};
```

### Policy Features

1. **Retry Policy**
   - Configurable max attempts (1-10)
   - Multiple backoff strategies: exponential, linear, constant
   - Configurable initial delay (100ms-5000ms)
   - Configurable max delay (1000ms-60000ms)

2. **Timeout Policy**
   - Configurable timeout duration (1000ms-300000ms)
   - Prevents long-running operations from hanging
   - Tracks timeout occurrences in metrics

3. **Circuit Breaker Policy**
   - Toggleable enable/disable
   - Configurable failure threshold (1-100 failures)
   - Configurable half-open timeout (1000ms-300000ms)
   - Configurable success threshold for recovery (1-10 successes)
   - States: closed, open, half-open

4. **Bulkhead Policy**
   - Toggleable enable/disable
   - Configurable max concurrent executions (1-100)
   - Configurable queue size (0-1000)
   - Prevents resource exhaustion

## Configuration Interface

The resilience configuration is exposed via the shared `ProviderConfig` schema:

```typescript
export const ProviderConfigSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  apiKey: z.string(),
  baseUrl: z.string().url(),
  timeout: z.number().default(30000),
  retries: z.number().default(3),
  enabled: z.boolean().default(true),
  resilience: ResiliencePolicyConfigSchema.optional()
});
```

This allows providers to be configured with custom resilience policies while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Implementation

### BaseProvider Integration

The `BaseProvider` class in `/home/jeffreymoya/dev/photoeditor/backend/src/providers/base.provider.ts` initializes resilience policies on construction:

```typescript
constructor(config: ProviderConfig) {
  this.config = config;

  // Initialize resilience policy with config or defaults
  const resilienceConfig = config.resilience || DEFAULT_RESILIENCE_CONFIG;
  const { execute, getMetrics } = createResiliencePolicy(resilienceConfig);
  this.resiliencePolicyExecute = execute;
  this.getResilienceMetrics = getMetrics;
}
```

All provider requests are wrapped with the resilience policy:

```typescript
protected async makeRequest<T>(request: () => Promise<T>): Promise<ProviderResponse> {
  // Execute request through resilience policy pipeline
  const data = await this.resiliencePolicyExecute(request);
  // ... response handling
}
```

### Concrete Provider Implementations

Both `GeminiProvider` and `SeedreamProvider` leverage the resilience policies through the base class:

- **GeminiProvider** (`/home/jeffreymoya/dev/photoeditor/backend/src/providers/gemini.provider.ts`)
  - Wraps Gemini AI API calls
  - Uses default timeout of 30s
  - Uses default retry of 3 attempts

- **SeedreamProvider** (`/home/jeffreymoya/dev/photoeditor/backend/src/providers/seedream.provider.ts`)
  - Wraps Seedream editing API calls
  - Uses default timeout of 30s
  - Uses default retry of 3 attempts

## Test Results

### Resilience Policy Tests

All resilience policy unit tests pass successfully:

```
PASS tests/unit/providers/resilience-policy.test.ts
  ResiliencePolicyBuilder
    Retry Policy
      ✓ should retry failed operations up to maxAttempts (39 ms)
      ✓ should fail after exhausting retry attempts (85 ms)
      ✓ should use exponential backoff strategy (304 ms)
    Timeout Policy
      ✓ should timeout long-running operations (103 ms)
      ✓ should not timeout fast operations (52 ms)
    Circuit Breaker Policy
      ✓ should open circuit after consecutive failures (5 ms)
      ✓ should track circuit breaker state in metrics (1 ms)
    Bulkhead Policy
      ✓ should limit concurrent executions when enabled (204 ms)
      ✓ should not limit concurrency when disabled (52 ms)
    Default Configuration
      ✓ should use default configuration when not specified
      ✓ should apply default resilience config values (1 ms)
    Metrics Collection
      ✓ should track retry attempts in metrics (11 ms)
      ✓ should reset metrics between policy executions (11 ms)
```

### BaseProvider Tests

All BaseProvider integration tests pass successfully:

```
PASS tests/unit/providers/base-provider.test.ts
  BaseProvider with Resilience Policies
    Configuration and Initialization
      ✓ should initialize with default resilience config when not provided
      ✓ should initialize with custom resilience config

      ✓ should retry failed operations and eventually succeed (24 ms)
      ✓ should fail after exhausting retries (32 ms)
    Timeout Behavior
      ✓ should timeout long-running operations (106 ms)
      ✓ should complete fast operations successfully (55 ms)
    Provider Enabled/Disabled
      ✓ should reject requests when provider is disabled

      ✓ should include resilience metrics in failed response (23 ms)
    Provider Response Structure
      ✓ should return properly structured ProviderResponse
```

## Metrics and Observability

The resilience policies expose metrics that are included in provider responses:

```typescript
export interface ResiliencePolicyMetrics {
  retryAttempts: number;
  circuitBreakerState: 'closed' | 'open' | 'half-open';
  timeoutOccurred: boolean;
  bulkheadRejected: boolean;
}
```

These metrics are automatically included in the `ProviderResponse.metadata.resilience` field, enabling:

- AWS Powertools logging integration
- CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- Observability into provider health and performance
- Debugging and troubleshooting

## Alignment with Standards

This implementation aligns with the following standards:

### standards/backend-tier.md
- ✅ Provider adapters use resilience policies rather than custom retry loops
- ✅ Circuit breaker metrics exposed for Powertools logging
- ✅ Provider classes kept under 200 LOC
- ✅ Strategy + Abstract Factory pattern maintained

### standards/cross-cutting.md
- ✅ Resilience policies configured as code
- ✅ Hard fail controls enforced (no AWS SDK imports in handlers)
- ✅ Observability requirements met via metrics

### standards/global.md
- ✅ Maintainability through configurable, testable policies
- ✅ Evidence bundle provided (this report)

### standards/shared-contracts-tier.md
- ✅ Configuration exposed via shared Zod schemas
- ✅ Contract-first API design maintained
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing interfaces

## Validation Commands

All validation commands pass successfully:

```bash
# Provider unit tests
pnpm turbo run test:unit --filter=@photoeditor/backend -- tests/unit/providers
# PASS - All provider tests passing

# Linting
pnpm turbo run lint --filter=@photoeditor/backend
# PASS - No lint errors
```

## Conclusion

The resilience policy implementation successfully provides:

1. **Configurable resilience patterns** - Retry, timeout, circuit breaker, and bulkhead policies
2. **Shared configuration** - Exposed via `@photoeditor/shared` package for consistency
3. **Metrics and observability** - Policy state exposed in response metadata
4. **Standards compliance** - Aligned with backend-tier, cross-cutting, and global standards
5. **Test coverage** - Comprehensive unit tests for all policy behaviors
6. **Backward compatibility** - Existing providers work without configuration changes

The implementation is production-ready and provides the foundation for reliable AI provider integration.
