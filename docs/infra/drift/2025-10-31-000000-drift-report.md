# Drift Detection Report

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-31 00:00:00 UTC
**Status**: no-drift
**Environment**: dev
**Terraform Version**: 1.9.0

## Summary

✅ No drift detected. Infrastructure matches Terraform state.

## Drift Details

```
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Terraform will perform the following actions:

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration
and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
```

## Next Steps

No action required. Continue monitoring.

## Context

This is a sample drift report demonstrating the expected format when no infrastructure drift is detected. Actual drift reports are generated weekly by the automated GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`.

### Current State (Phase 2)

- **SST Stacks**: Currently provisioning resources inline (see `infra/sst/stacks/`)
- **Terraform Modules**: Defined but not yet consumed by SST (see `infrastructure/modules/`)
- **Parity Status**: Phase 2 - Module definitions exist, SST migration pending
- **Known Gaps**: SST resources not yet tracked by Terraform state (expected during migration)

### Expected Drift During Migration

During Phase 2 of ADR-0008 implementation, drift reports will show:

1. **Missing Resources**: Terraform doesn't know about SST-provisioned resources yet
2. **Configuration Differences**: SST inline configs vs. module-based configs
3. **Parity Gaps**: Resources defined in SST but not in Terraform

This is expected and will be resolved as SST stacks migrate to consume Terraform modules.

**Note**: This is an initial sample report created during TASK-0823 implementation. Real drift detection reports will be generated automatically starting with the first scheduled workflow run after this task is merged.
