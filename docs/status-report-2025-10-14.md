# Status Report â€” October 14, 2025

## Summary
- Unblocked `backend` presign/status integration tests by allowing Jest to reach LocalStack (`tests/setup.js`) and seeding SSM params in the suite setup.
- Updated `tests/integration/presign-status.integration.test.ts` to reset fixtures per test, align assertions with current `ErrorHandler` output, and ensure deterministic UUIDs without poisoning other suites.
- Investigated worker pipeline integration failures; they now connect to LocalStack but still fail because the S3 client used by `S3Service.optimizeAndUploadImage` is not mocked after the first test, leading to `NoSuchBucket` errors.

## Current Test State
- `npm run test:integration --prefix backend`
  - Presign & status suites pass.
  - `worker-pipeline.integration.test.ts` fails (mocking bug described above).

## Next Steps / Recommendations
1. Refactor worker pipeline suite to inject a mocked `S3Service` (or patch `S3Spy` so it wraps clients created after module import) and re-run the suite.
2. Once the mocks are stable, re-enable assertions that verify batch progress, fallback copies, and idempotency paths.
3. After worker tests pass, run `npm run qa-suite:static` per repo standards before opening a PR.
