# Lean template for LLM-executable tasks (token-optimized for solo developer)
# Copy to: tasks/<area>/TASK-<id>-<short-slug>.task.yaml
# See tasks/README.md for authoring guide
#
# Standards alignment:
# - standards/global.md (universal guardrails)
# - standards/AGENTS.md (tier taxonomy)
# - Tier-specific: backend-tier.md | frontend-tier.md | shared-contracts-tier.md | infrastructure-tier.md | cross-cutting.md
# - standards/testing-standards.md (coverage expectations)
#
# Note: Integration, E2E, and mutation tests are deferred for now in this
# repository. Keep coverage thresholds in place; do not add mutation/E2E
# requirements unless explicitly reintroduced by a future ADR/task.
# If the task is blocked by an unrelated issue, set status=blocked, fill blocked_reason,
# and author a separate unblocker task referenced via blocked_by.
