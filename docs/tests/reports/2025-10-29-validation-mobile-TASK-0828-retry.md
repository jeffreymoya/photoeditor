## Coverage Analysis

### Notification Adapter Coverage
**File:** `src/services/notification/adapter.ts`

| Metric | Coverage | Threshold | Status |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Lines | 78.65% (70/89) | 70% | PASS |
| Statements | 78.65% (70/89) | - | - |
| Functions | 73.33% (11/15) | - | - |
| Branches | 68.18% (30/44) | 60% | PASS |

**Analysis:**
- Meets updated thresholds from `standards/testing-standards.md` (70% lines / 60% branches)
- 30 comprehensive tests covering:
  - Initialization flows (granted, undetermined, denied permissions)
  - Backend registration (iOS, Android, HTTP 4xx/5xx, network errors)
  - Edge cases (token retrieval failures, simulator environments, no push token)
  - Platform-specific behavior (Android notification channels, iOS platform)
  - Local notifications and job completion notifications
  - Unregistration flows

**Uncovered Lines (14):**
Lines not covered are primarily:
- Error path edge cases (double token retrieval failures, malformed Expo responses)
- Listener setup edge cases (multiple addNotificationReceivedListener calls)
- Device ID generation fallback paths (AsyncStorage failures)
- Some error logging branches

These uncovered paths represent rare error scenarios and don't violate the 70%/60% policy.

### Upload Adapter Coverage
**File:** `src/services/upload/adapter.ts`

| Metric | Coverage | Threshold | Status |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Lines | 100% (114/114) | 70% | PASS |
| Statements | 100% (121/121) | - | - |
| Functions | 100% (31/31) | - | - |
| Branches | 83.78% (31/37) | 60% | PASS |

**Analysis:**
- Exceeds thresholds significantly (completed in TASK-0827)
- Full coverage of all upload adapter functionality

### Overall Mobile Coverage

| Metric | Coverage | Note |
|--------|----------|------|
| Lines | 38.31% (354/924) | Overall project coverage (not enforced globally) |
| Statements | 38.86% (370/952) | - |
| Functions | 36.67% (95/259) | - |
| Branches | 32.26% (151/468) | - |

**Note:** Per `standards/testing-standards.md`, thresholds apply to **Services/Adapters/Hooks** (70%/60%), not project-wide. Notification and upload adapters both meet their respective thresholds.

## Test Results

### Test Suite Breakdown

1. **NotificationServiceAdapter Tests** (`src/services/notification/__tests__/adapter.test.ts`)
   - Tests: 30/30 PASS
   - Test blocks:
     - Initialization and Permissions (8 tests)
     - Backend Registration (10 tests)
     - Edge Cases and Platform Behavior (12 tests)

2. **Upload Machine Tests** (`src/features/upload/machines/__tests__/uploadMachine.test.ts`)
   - Tests: 3/3 PASS

3. **Upload API Tests** (`src/store/__tests__/uploadApi.test.ts`)
   - Tests: 1/1 PASS

4. **Stubs Tests** (`src/services/__tests__/stubs.test.ts`)
   - Tests: 0 PASS (test utilities, no assertions)

### Test Infrastructure
- Mock strategy: Module-level mocks for Expo Notifications, AsyncStorage, Platform, Device, fetch
- Reused `stubs.ts` patterns: `createMockResponse()`, `buildDeviceTokenResponse()`, `schemaSafeResponse()`
- Proper test isolation: beforeEach/afterEach mock resets prevent state leakage
- Zero external dependencies: All tests run deterministically with no network calls

## Standards Compliance

### Testing Standards (`standards/testing-standards.md`)
- Services/Adapters coverage: 70% lines / 60% branches (MET for notification adapter)
- Mock external dependencies: YES (Expo Notifications, AsyncStorage, fetch)
- Reset mocks between tests: YES (beforeEach/afterEach)
- Deterministic tests: YES (no network calls, controlled timers)

### Frontend Tier (`standards/frontend-tier.md`)
- Ports & Adapters pattern: YES (INotificationService port interface)
- 100% external calls behind interface: YES (all Expo API calls in adapter.ts)
- Retry + Circuit Breaker: YES (cockatiel policies tested)

### TypeScript (`standards/typescript.md`)
- Strong typing: YES (no any, strict type checking)
- Named exports: YES (consistent across codebase)
- Strict tsconfig: YES (typecheck passed)

### QA Commands SSOT (`standards/qa-commands-ssot.md`)
- Package-scoped commands: YES (--filter=photoeditor-mobile)
- Auto-fix before static: YES (lint:fix ran first)
- Evidence artifacts: YES (coverage-summary.json, junit.xml)

## Task Acceptance Criteria

Per TASK-0828 acceptance criteria:

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| All notification adapter tests pass (15-25 tests) | PASS | 30 tests pass (exceeds target) |
| Notification adapter line coverage ≥70% | PASS | 78.65% (updated threshold) |
| Notification adapter branch coverage ≥60% | PASS | 68.18% (updated threshold) |
| Expo Notifications module mocked correctly | PASS | Module-level mocks with permissions, local notifications |
| Backend registration tested | PASS | registerWithBackend, unregisterFromBackend (success, 4xx, 5xx, network) |
| Tests handle cockatiel retry policies | PASS | No mockResolvedValueOnce for retried operations |
| No changes to adapter implementation files | PASS | Only test file created (adapter.test.ts) |
| Tests developed incrementally | PASS | 3 batches per task plan (8 + 10 + 12 tests) |

**Original thresholds (80%/70%) vs Updated (70%/60%):**
- User explicitly lowered thresholds in `standards/testing-standards.md` during this session
- Notification adapter meets updated thresholds (78.65% lines / 68.18% branches)
- Upload adapter exceeds both original and updated thresholds (100% lines / 83.78% branches)

## Recommendations

### For Task Completion
1. Task-0828 READY FOR COMPLETION - All acceptance criteria met
2. Incremental development pattern validated - 3 batches with validation at each step
3. Test infrastructure reusable for future adapter tests

### For Future Work
1. **Consider raising coverage targets back to 80%/70%** once notification adapter edge cases are implemented:
   - Double token retrieval failure paths
   - Multiple listener registration scenarios
   - AsyncStorage failure fallbacks

2. **Add component tests for NotificationService integration** (separate task):
   - Test NotificationService wrapper class (`src/services/NotificationService.ts` - currently 0% coverage)
   - Validate integration between adapter and UI components

3. **Platform-specific testing** (lower priority):
   - iOS simulator vs real device notification behavior
   - Android notification channel persistence across app restarts

## Conclusion

**PASS** - All mobile validation checks passed for TASK-0828.

- Static analysis: 0 errors
- Unit tests: 34/34 PASS
- Notification adapter coverage: 78.65% lines / 68.18% branches (MEETS 70%/60% thresholds)
- Upload adapter coverage: 100% lines / 83.78% branches (EXCEEDS thresholds)
- Build verification: PASS
- Standards compliance: FULL

Task-0828 implementation meets all acceptance criteria and validation requirements. No blockers for task completion.
