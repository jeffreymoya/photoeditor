- Total mobile tests: 148/148 PASS
- Test suites: 8/8 PASS
- Test execution time: 9.196s

### Coverage Analysis

❌ **FAIL** - Coverage thresholds not met for notification adapter

**Required Thresholds** (per standards/testing-standards.md and standards/frontend-tier.md):
- Services/Adapters: ≥80% line coverage, ≥70% branch coverage

**Actual Coverage (services/notification/adapter.ts):**
- Line coverage: **78.65%** (❌ 1.35% below threshold)
- Branch coverage: **68.18%** (❌ 1.82% below threshold)
- Function coverage: 73.33%
- Statement coverage: 78.65%

**Uncovered Lines:** 26, 99-103, 108-152, 202-203, 286

**Coverage Gap Analysis:**
The uncovered lines primarily consist of:
1. Line 26: Logger initialization edge case
2. Lines 99-103: Notification handler initialization error path
3. Lines 108-152: `handleJobNotification` method (entire method uncovered)
4. Lines 202-203: Job notification navigation logic
5. Line 286: Unregister error edge case

## Issues Fixed During Validation

Per agent scope (simple infrastructure issues only), the following were fixed:

### 1. Complexity Violation in stubs.ts
**File:** `mobile/src/services/__tests__/stubs.ts`
**Issue:** `buildBatchJob` function complexity 11 (exceeds limit of 10)
**Fix:** Refactored to extract defaults object, reducing inline ternary operations
**Standards Ref:** standards/cross-cutting.md (complexity budgets)

### 2. Unreachable Code Warning in testUtils.ts
**File:** `mobile/src/services/__tests__/testUtils.ts`
**Issue:** ESLint unreachable code warning in createPollingScenario
**Fix:** Restructured try-catch to move error handling into returned function
**Standards Ref:** standards/typescript.md (strict type checking)

### 3. TypeScript Errors in ApiService.test.ts
**File:** `mobile/src/services/__tests__/ApiService.test.ts`
**Issue:** Object possibly undefined / Type undefined not assignable to string
**Fix:** Added type assertions with optional chaining: `requestCall[1]?.body as string`
**Standards Ref:** standards/typescript.md (strict tsconfig, exactOptionalPropertyTypes)

### 4. TypeScript Function Type Error in testUtils.ts
**File:** `mobile/src/services/__tests__/testUtils.ts`
**Issue:** Not all constituents of union type are callable
**Fix:** Added explicit type guard: `(step as () => Partial<SchemaInfer<TSchema>>)()`
**Standards Ref:** standards/typescript.md (strong typing, no any)

### 5. exactOptionalPropertyTypes Error in testUtils.ts
**File:** `mobile/src/services/__tests__/testUtils.ts`
**Issue:** Type undefined not assignable to optional property with exactOptionalPropertyTypes
**Fix:** Conditional property assignment instead of passing undefined
**Standards Ref:** standards/typescript.md (strict tsconfig)

### 6. Jest Mock Mutation Issue in adapter.test.ts
**File:** `mobile/src/services/notification/__tests__/adapter.test.ts`
**Issue:** Device mock not properly mutable across tests causing simulator test to fail
**Fix:** Changed jest.mock to use getters that reference mutable mockDevice object
**Standards Ref:** standards/testing-standards.md (deterministic mocks, reset between tests)

## Deferred Issues

Per agent's hard-fail guardrails, the following are DEFERRED to implementation team:

### Coverage Gaps in adapter.ts

**Lines 108-152: handleJobNotification method**
- **Reason for Deferral:** Application logic requiring navigation mocking and job notification integration testing
- **Impact:** Primary driver of coverage gap (45 lines uncovered)
- **Recommended Action:** Add integration tests with navigation mock to cover job notification handling flows
- **Complexity:** Requires React Navigation mocking and Redux integration

**Other Uncovered Lines (26, 99-103, 202-203, 286)**
- **Reason for Deferral:** Edge cases and error paths requiring specific error injection scenarios
- **Impact:** Minor contribution to coverage gap (8 lines total)
- **Recommended Action:** Add tests for logger edge cases, notification handler errors, and navigation flows

## Standards Compliance

### Testing Standards (standards/testing-standards.md)

✅ **Test Authoring:**
- Named specs `*.test.ts` colocated with subject under test
- Pure unit tests with deterministic inputs/outputs
- External dependencies mocked (Expo Notifications, AsyncStorage, Platform, Device, fetch)
- Assertions focused on observable behavior
- Mocks reset between test cases using beforeEach/afterEach

❌ **Coverage Expectations:**
- Services/Adapters: **FAIL** (78.65% lines < 80%, 68.18% branches < 70%)

✅ **Prohibited Patterns:**
- No network calls to real services (all mocked)
- No global mutable state between tests (proper cleanup)
- Deterministic mocks (no sleep-based polling)

### Frontend Tier Standards (standards/frontend-tier.md)

✅ **Services & Integration Layer:**
- Ports & Adapters pattern (adapter.ts implements port.ts interface)
- Expo Notifications with thin adapter
- 100% of external calls behind interface in services/notification/port.ts

✅ **Fitness Gates:**
- Contract drift: N/A (no server-side contract for notification adapter)
- Interface audit: PASS (all Expo Notifications calls behind INotificationService)

### Cross-Cutting Standards (standards/cross-cutting.md)

✅ **Code Quality:**
- Complexity: PASS (all functions ≤10 after fixes)
- Type Safety: PASS (no any, strict TypeScript)
- No circular dependencies

## Final Status Summary

**Status:** ❌ FAIL
**Static:** ✅ PASS
**Tests:** 30/30 PASS (notification adapter), 148/148 PASS (total mobile)
**Coverage:** ❌ 78.65%L/68.18%B (notification adapter - below 80%/70% thresholds)
**Fixed:** 6 infrastructure issues
**Deferred:** Coverage gaps in handleJobNotification and edge cases
**Report:** docs/tests/reports/2025-10-29-validation-mobile-TASK-0828.md

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Add tests for `handleJobNotification` method to cover primary coverage gap (lines 108-152)
2. **High Priority:** Test notification handler initialization error paths (lines 99-103)
3. **Medium Priority:** Test navigation integration for job notifications (lines 202-203)
4. **Low Priority:** Test edge cases in logger initialization and unregister errors (lines 26, 286)

## Agent Notes

This validation identified infrastructure issues (lint, type errors) that were within agent scope to fix per standards/AGENTS.md. Coverage gaps in application logic (handleJobNotification, navigation integration) are deferred to implementation team as they require feature-level testing beyond unit test scope.

Per agent hard-fail guardrails, no tests were weakened, no coverage thresholds were relaxed, and no TypeScript/lint rules were disabled to achieve passing results. The FAIL status accurately reflects that coverage thresholds were not met per standards/testing-standards.md.
