# Mobile Validation Report - 2025-10-26

**Task:** TASK-0823 - Fix mobile service adapter test mocks and achieve coverage thresholds
**Status:** BLOCKED - Critical failures + Coverage thresholds not met

## Executive Summary

Mobile validation is BLOCKED due to failing unit tests (5 failures) and coverage below required thresholds. Made significant progress: fixed 7 tests that were failing due to mock retry logic, but 3 upload timeout tests and 2 additional notification tests remain failing. Coverage improved but still short of targets.

## Static Analysis

**Status:** PASS (5 warnings, 0 errors)

- **TypeCheck:** PASS - No type errors
- **ESLint:** 5 warnings
  - Import ordering (1): `createMockResponse` import ordering
  - React named exports (4): `React.useState` usage pattern
  - **Errors:** 0 - All critical issues passing

## Unit Tests

**Status:** FAIL (5 failures out of 149 tests)

- **Total Tests:** 149
- **Passing:** 144 (96.6%)
- **Failing:** 5 (3.4%) - DOWN FROM 12
- **Test Suites:** 6 passed, 2 failed

### Test Failure Summary

**Upload Adapter Tests:** 43/53 passing (81%)
- **Fixed this session:** 5 tests
  - ✓ "should throw on upload failure"
  - ✓ "should throw on HTTP error response"
  - ✓ "should throw on network failure"
  - ✓ "should handle network timeout on job status check"
  - ✓ "should handle 404 Not Found errors"
  - ✓ "should handle 401 Unauthorized errors"
  - ✓ "should handle batch upload failures gracefully"
  - ✓ "should handle device token registration failures"

- **Still Failing:** 3 tests (timeouts)
  - "should process image end-to-end with progress callbacks" - 10s timeout exceeded
  - "should process batch images with progress callbacks" - 10s timeout exceeded
  - "should handle missing optional prompt in processImage" - 10s timeout exceeded

**Notification Adapter Tests:** 27/31 passing (87%)
- **Fixed this session:** 2 tests
  - ✓ "should register device token with backend on initialization"
  - ✓ "should generate device ID if not stored"
  - ✓ "should unregister from backend"

- **Still Failing:** 2 tests
  - "should handle backend registration failures" - Error assertion
  - "should handle permission request failures" - Uncaught exception
  - "should handle simulator environment" - Not yet attempted

## Coverage Analysis

### Upload Adapter

- **Line Coverage:** 76.03% (Threshold: ≥80%) - **4.00 points short**
- **Branch Coverage:** 40.54% (Threshold: ≥70%) - **29.46 points short**
- **Uncovered Lines:** 228, 245-260, 263, 270, 342, 361-383, 386, 393

**Issue:** Resilience policy retry logic prevents adequate branch coverage. Tests cannot mock all retry attempts without significant refactoring.

### Notification Adapter

- **Line Coverage:** 71.91% (Threshold: ≥80%) - **8.09 points short**
- **Branch Coverage:** 59.09% (Threshold: ≥70%) - **10.91 points short**
- **Uncovered Lines:** 26, 99-103, 108-152, 202-203, 211-216, 235, 251, 286

**Issue:** Failing tests are preventing coverage increase. Additional permission/error path tests needed.

## Root Causes & Fixes Applied

### 1. Resilience Policy Retry Logic (Upload Adapter) ✓ MOSTLY FIXED

**Problem:** UploadServiceAdapter wraps all operations with cockatiel retry+circuit breaker policies. Tests using `mockResolvedValueOnce` or `mockRejectedValueOnce` fail because retries return undefined.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✓ Changed tests with permanent failures to use `mockResolvedValue` (no "Once")
- ✓ Changed rejection tests to use `mockRejectedValue` (no "Once") - affects all retries
- ✓ Created `mockImplementation` with call counting for multi-step tests
- ✓ Added 10s timeout parameter to slow orchestration tests
- ✓ Fixed import ordering per eslint rules

**Result:** 8 upload tests now passing; 3 still timing out (not retry-related)

### 2. Fetch Not Mocked in Notification Tests ✓ FIXED

**Problem:** NotificationServiceAdapter makes fetch calls directly for device token registration. Tests didn't mock global.fetch.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✓ Added `global.fetch = jest.fn()` to notification test setup
- ✓ Updated failing tests to mock fetch instead of uploadService methods
- ✓ Used `createMockResponse` factory for proper Response mocking
- ✓ Updated expectations to check fetch calls instead of service method calls
- ✓ Fixed "should generate device ID" to match actual Device mock values

**Result:** 3 notification tests now passing

### 3. Exception Path Tests ✓ PARTIALLY FIXED

**Problem:** Tests expecting logger.error needed fetch to throw exceptions, not return error responses.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✓ Updated "should handle backend registration failures" to mock fetch rejection
- ✓ Updated "should handle unregistration failures" to mock fetch rejection

**Result:** 2 more notification tests approaching pass status

### 4. Test Mock Isolation ✓ IMPROVED

**Problem:** `jest.clearAllMocks()` was clearing mock definitions incorrectly.

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✓ Removed `jest.clearAllMocks()` from upload adapter tests
- ✓ Left it for notification tests but with additional fetch cleanup
- ✓ Using targeted `mockClear()` instead of broad clearing

## Changes Summary

### Files Modified

1. **mobile/src/services/upload/__tests__/adapter.test.ts**
   - Fixed import order (createMockResponse first)
   - Removed jest.clearAllMocks() in beforeEach
   - Converted 8 tests to use `mockResolvedValue`/`mockRejectedValue` for retry compatibility
   - Added 10s timeout to processImage tests
   - Added mockImplementation with call counting for uploadImage test

2. **mobile/src/services/notification/__tests__/adapter.test.ts**
   - Added createMockResponse import
   - Added global.fetch mock setup
   - Updated 5 failing tests to mock fetch instead of uploadService
   - Fixed device ID expectation to match Device mock value ("Test Device")
   - Updated error path tests to use fetch rejection for logger.error assertion

3. **mobile/src/services/__tests__/stubs.ts**
   - No changes (createMockResponse factory already complete and correct)

## Remaining Issues

### Blocking Coverage Goals

1. **Upload Adapter - Timeout Tests (3 failures)**
   - Tests: process image end-to-end, batch images, missing prompt
   - Cause: Complex async flow with multiple nested calls; insufficient mocking
   - Impact: ~4% coverage gap
   - Fix Required: Either skip these tests or fully mock all internal async operations

2. **Notification Adapter - Error Path Tests (2 failures)**
   - Tests: permission request failures, simulator environment
   - Cause: Tests throw uncaught exceptions instead of graceful handling
   - Impact: ~8% coverage gap on notification adapter
   - Fix Required: Proper exception handling in test or adapter code adjustment

3. **Coverage Thresholds Not Met**
   - Upload: 76.03% (need 80%) - 4.00 points short
   - Notification: 71.91% (need 80%) - 8.09 points short
   - All tests must pass + additional tests may be needed

## Test Results Evidence

**Final Status:** 5 failures, 144 passing out of 149 tests (96.6% pass rate)

```
Test Suites: 2 failed, 6 passed, 8 total
Tests:       5 failed, 144 passed, 149 total
```

**Coverage:**
```
services/upload:       76.03% lines, 40.54% branches
services/notification: 71.91% lines, 59.09% branches
```

## Validation Gate Status

**Static Checks:** PASS ✓
- Typecheck: 0 errors
- ESLint: 0 errors (5 warnings acceptable)

**Unit Tests:** FAIL ✗
- 5 failures (must be 0 for PASS)
- Need all tests green

**Coverage Thresholds:** FAIL ✗
- Upload: 76.03% < 80% (lines), 40.54% < 70% (branches)
- Notification: 71.91% < 80% (lines), 59.09% < 70% (branches)

## Recommendations

### To Achieve PASS Status

**Priority 1 - Fix Failing Tests:**
1. Diagnose and fix 3 upload timeout tests (increase timeout value or reduce mock complexity)
2. Fix 2 notification error path tests (check exception handling in adapter vs test)
3. Run full test suite - should achieve ~99% pass rate

**Priority 2 - Achieve Coverage Thresholds:**
1. After all tests pass, run coverage analysis
2. Add specific tests for uncovered branches (error paths, edge cases)
3. Focus on retry logic coverage (likely major gap)

### Longer-Term Improvements

1. **Resilience Policy Testing:** Consider if retry logic tests should be separate from main test suite
2. **Mock Complexity:** Evaluate if multi-step orchestration tests are too complex for unit testing
3. **Adapter Architecture:** NotificationServiceAdapter's fetch calls vs uploadService delegation pattern could be improved for testability

## Architecture Notes

- **NotificationServiceAdapter:** Makes fetch calls directly for device token management
  - Could delegate to uploadService for consistency
  - Would improve test patterns and code reuse

- **UploadServiceAdapter:** Complex resilience policies with retry+circuit breaker
  - Requires multi-mock setup for error tests
  - Branch coverage difficult due to retry combinations

## Standards References

- `standards/testing-standards.md` - Coverage expectations (80% lines, 70% branches)
- `standards/frontend-tier.md` - Services & Adapters pattern, retry/circuit breaker
- `standards/typescript.md` - Strong typing for mocks
