# Dispatch Registry for Tasks CLI Command Routing
#
# This registry maps CLI commands to their handler type:
# - 'legacy': Uses argparse-based handlers in __main__.py
# - 'typer': Uses Typer framework handlers (to be implemented in Wave 1)
#
# Wave 1 Migration Plan:
# - list, validate, explain will be first to migrate to Typer
# - Other commands will follow in subsequent waves
#
# Environment Variable Override:
# - TASKS_CLI_LEGACY_DISPATCH=1 forces all commands to use legacy handlers
#   regardless of this registry (for emergency rollback)
