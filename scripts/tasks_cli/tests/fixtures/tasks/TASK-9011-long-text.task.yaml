title: Task with very long text fields to test YAML serialization and text wrapping edge cases in the context store normalization process
status: todo
priority: P2
area: shared
description: |
  This task has intentionally very long text fields to test YAML serialization,
  text wrapping, line length handling, and ensure that the context store can
  handle large amounts of text data without corruption or truncation. This is
  important for real-world tasks that may have extensive documentation or
  detailed implementation notes that span multiple paragraphs and contain
  technical details, code snippets, and other information that needs to be
  preserved exactly as written by the task author.

  The following is a very long paragraph with no line breaks to test wrapping:

scope:
  in:
    - This is a very long scope item that describes in detail all the files and directories that are in scope for this task including backend handlers services and providers as well as mobile screens components and shared contracts that need to be updated as part of this comprehensive refactoring effort
    - Another very long scope item: shared/schemas/upload.ts, shared/schemas/download.ts, shared/schemas/job.ts, shared/types/upload.ts, shared/types/download.ts, shared/types/job.ts, shared/utils/validation.ts, shared/utils/helpers.ts
  out:
    - Infrastructure changes are explicitly out of scope for this task

plan:
  - "Step 1: This is a very long plan step that describes in extensive detail what needs to be done including analyzing the current codebase, identifying areas for improvement, designing the new architecture, and implementing the changes in a backwards-compatible manner while maintaining test coverage and ensuring no regressions are introduced during the refactoring process"
  - "Step 2: Another long step with implementation details"
  - "Step 3: Final validation and testing step"

acceptance_criteria:
  - criteria: This is a very long acceptance criteria description that specifies exactly what conditions must be met for this task to be considered complete including all technical requirements, quality thresholds, and validation steps that must pass
    standards_ref: standards/typescript.md#validation

validation:
  commands:
    - cmd: pnpm turbo run typecheck --filter=@photoeditor/shared && pnpm turbo run lint --filter=@photoeditor/shared && pnpm turbo run test --filter=@photoeditor/shared --coverage
      description: Run complete validation suite including type checking, linting, and unit tests with coverage reporting to ensure all quality gates pass

deliverables:
  - description: A very long deliverable description that explains what this file does, why it's important, how it fits into the overall architecture, and what specific functionality it provides to the system as a whole
