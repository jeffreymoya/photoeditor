# Standards Overview (Index Only)

Important

- Governance SSOT: `standards/standards-governance-ssot.md` — follow for grounding and standards change requests.
- Task Breakdown Canon: `standards/task-breakdown-canon.md` — follow for decomposition when tasks are complex or blocked.
- For QA commands, use `standards/qa-commands-ssot.md` (commands only; thresholds live in testing/cross‑cutting standards).
- Task Context Cache: All agents must use `python scripts/tasks.py --get-context` to load immutable task context (standards citations, scope, validation baseline) rather than reading from standards files directly. See `docs/proposals/task-context-cache.md` for full specification.

This file is an index. Do not restate rules, thresholds, or libraries here. Always consult and cite the tier/TypeScript standards directly.
