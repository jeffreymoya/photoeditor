clarifications:
  outstanding:
    - Confirm expected provider success vs. fallback coverage depth so new tests exercise the same branches required by standards/backend-tier.md#domain-service-layer.
    - Decide whether to stub global fetch or introduce an HTTP seam before writing tests, per standards/typescript.md#3-analyzability.

description: >-
  On 2025-11-09 the backend package failed Jest coverage checks because
  `backend/src/services/imageProcessing.service.ts` reported 4.54% statements/lines and
  0% branches/functions, far below the enforced thresholds (≥80% statements/lines, ≥70%
  branches, ≥75% functions). This task designs deterministic unit tests and supporting
  seams so the orchestration service meets PhotoEditor's coverage standards while
  documenting the evidence trail for future audits.
outcome: >-
  ImageProcessing Orchestration Service owns comprehensive unit tests that cover success,
  fallback, and batch-notification paths, raising statements/lines to ≥80%, branches to
  ≥70%, and functions to ≥75%; coverage evidence and clarifications are archived and the
  backend qa pipelines run cleanly.

    title: Capture coverage gaps and standards context
    details: >-
      Review `backend/src/services/imageProcessing.service.ts`, the failing Jest report, and
      standards/backend-tier.md#domain-service-layer + standards/testing-standards.md#coverage-expectations
      to catalogue the uncovered branches (success path, provider fallback, batch notifications).
      Record open questions and decisions in the clarifications evidence file before exiting draft state.

    title: Add deterministic service seams and tests
    details: >-
      Design pure seams or spies for JobService, S3Service, NotificationService, ProviderFactory, and fetch
      so ImageProcessing Orchestration Service can be tested without external IO. Implement targeted unit tests
      covering success, editing fallback, and batch updates, keeping logic compliant with standards/backend-tier.md#domain-service-layer
      and analyzable per standards/typescript.md#3-analyzability.

      - Implementation documents seams with comments referencing standards/backend-tier.md#domain-service-layer responsibility notes and keeps logic analyzable per standards/typescript.md#3-analyzability.
      - New/updated tests assert success + fallback + batch notification flows and encode provider expectations without real network calls.

  manual_checks: []
acceptance_criteria:
  must:
    - Jest thresholds for `backend/src/services/imageProcessing.service.ts` meet or exceed Statements ≥80%, Branches ≥70%, Lines ≥80%, Functions ≥75%, with proof in docs/evidence/coverage-reports/TASK-0913-image-processing-service.md.
    - Unit tests cover provider success, editing fallback, and batch-notification paths without relying on real S3 or HTTP calls, demonstrating compliance with standards/backend-tier.md#domain-service-layer.
  quality_gates:
    - Affected standards references remain satisfied; note any deviations and link the follow-up standards change request.
    - No lint/type errors in affected packages.

risks:
  - description: Network-bound behaviour in tests may introduce flakiness or slow suites if global fetch/S3 interactions are not stubbed.
    mitigation: Inject or mock fetch/S3 interactions with deterministic buffers per standards/typescript.md#3-analyzability so tests run in-memory.
