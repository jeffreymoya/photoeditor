description: >-
  Create an authoritative environment registry that captures SST and Terraform outputs per stage (dev, stage, prod), ties
  them to deployment timestamps, and stores evidence for audit. Standards/infrastructure-tier.md requires this registry to
  prove configuration drift is controlled.

outcome: >-
  A versioned registry document or automation populates environment metadata for each stage, persists it under docs/infra,
  and integrates with validation workflows so auditors can trace resource identifiers and their provenance.

scope:
  in:
    - scripts or automation that collect outputs from SST and Terraform
    - docs/infra/environment-registry.md (or generated JSON)
    - Updates to validation workflow notes referencing the registry
  out:
    - Changes to resource provisioning (handled in other tasks)
    - Secrets or runtime credentials (store references only)

  coding_guidelines:
    - Prefer automation over manual tables; registry should be reproducible.
    - Include timestamps and source commands for each entry.
  prohibited:
    - Do not store secrets or access keys; reference Secret Manager/SSM identifiers instead.

    title: Define registry schema and data sources
    details: >-
      Derive required fields (stage, stack, outputs, timestamps) from standards/infrastructure-tier.md#infrastructure-tier and
      governance expectations in standards/cross-cutting.md#governance--knowledge; document schema decisions in docs/infra/environment-registry.md.

    outputs:
      - docs/infra/environment-registry.md
    definition_of_done:
      - docs/infra/environment-registry.md lists schema fields with citations to standards/infrastructure-tier.md#infrastructure-tier and standards/cross-cutting.md#governance--knowledge.

    title: Implement data collection script or workflow
    details: >-
      Author scripts/infra/export-environment-registry.ts to gather SST/Terraform outputs and emit the schema, ensuring strict typing per standards/typescript.md#language--api-surface-rules.
    actor: agent
    inputs:

    outputs:
      - scripts/infra/export-environment-registry.ts
      - docs/infra/environment-registry.md
    definition_of_done:
      - Script produces JSON matching the schema without manual edits, includes inline references to standards/infrastructure-tier.md#infrastructure-tier, and passes strict type checks recorded in docs/infra/environment-registry.md.

    title: Publish registry artifact and documentation
    details: >-
      Commit generated registry under docs/infra and describe refresh cadence plus audit usage referencing standards/cross-cutting.md#governance--knowledge and standards/testing-standards.md#evidence-expectations.
    actor: agent
    inputs:
      - scripts/infra/export-environment-registry.ts

    title: Wire registry into validation workflow
    details: >-
      Update validation docs and agent playbooks to reference the registry so audits enforce standards/infrastructure-tier.md#infrastructure-tier without relaxing guardrails.
    actor: agent
    inputs:
      - docs/infra/environment-registry.md
      - .claude/agents/test-validation-backend.md
      - .claude/agents/test-validation-mobile.md

      - .claude/agents/test-validation-backend.md
      - .claude/agents/test-validation-mobile.md
      - .claude/agents/test-validation-shared.md
    definition_of_done:
      - Each validation doc references docs/infra/environment-registry.json and cites standards/infrastructure-tier.md#infrastructure-tier plus standards/cross-cutting.md#governance--knowledge; guardrail statements remain intact.
    estimate: S
    expected_files_touched:
      - docs/infra/terraform-control-plane-evidence.md

acceptance_criteria:
  must:
    - Environment registry artifact includes dev/stage/prod entries with stack names, key outputs, and last-validated dates.
    - Documentation explains update cadence and references standards/infrastructure-tier.md evidence requirements.
    - Validation docs/agents reference the registry without relaxing test or TypeScript guardrails.
    - Registry generation script runs via `pnpm` script with documentation.
  quality_gates:
    - Affected standards references remain satisfied; note any deviations and link the follow-up standards change request.
    - No lint/type errors in affected packages.

artifacts:
  - path: docs/infra/environment-registry.json
    description: Machine-readable registry of environment outputs per stage.
  - path: docs/infra/environment-registry.md
    description: Human-readable registry documentation and refresh procedure.

deliverables:
  - scripts/infra/export-environment-registry.ts
  - docs/infra/environment-registry.json
  - docs/infra/environment-registry.md
  - Updated validation agent documentation referencing the registry

risks:
  - description: Registry could drift if automation fails or outputs change unexpectedly.
    mitigation: Integrate registry generation into CI and add monitoring for stale timestamps.
