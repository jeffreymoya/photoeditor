title: "Add CameraWithOverlay loading sentinel for async feature flags"

clarifications:
  outstanding:
    - Confirm copy and accessibility requirements for the interim "Initializing camera" UI per product guidance.
    - Determine whether the sentinel should display metrics (e.g., feature flag readiness) for telemetry before Camera mounts.
  evidence_path: "docs/evidence/tasks/TASK-0918-clarifications.md"

description: >-
  Even after the act-aware helper lands, CameraWithOverlay still renders `null` while async feature flags
  resolve, which provides no user feedback and leaves tests without an observable loading state.
  Following the SettingsScreen precedent from TASK-0914, introduce a minimal loading sentinel rendered until
  `featureFlags` exist so both users and tests can detect readiness without extra polling.

outcome: >-
  CameraWithOverlay displays an accessible loading indicator (text + testID) while device capability checks
  run, tests wait for the sentinel to disappear before asserting, and pilot metrics confirm no regressions in
  frame-processor enablement.

scope:
  in:
    - mobile/src/features/camera/CameraWithOverlay.tsx (introduce loading view + optional analytics hook)
    - mobile/src/features/camera/__tests__/CameraWithOverlay.test.tsx (assert loading sentinel lifecycle)
    - mobile/src/features/camera/styles and related assets if needed for theming
  out:
    - Changes to VisionCamera configuration, frame processor logic, or feature-flag heuristic functions
    - Broader UI redesign of the camera screen beyond the minimal sentinel state

    - Keep UI strings centralized for localization readiness (standards/mobile-tier.md#i18n if applicable).
  prohibited:
    - Do not bypass feature flag guards or auto-enable frame processors just to hide loading time.

    title: Align sentinel design with standards
    details: >-
      Review TASK-0914 implementation notes and standards/frontend-tier.md#async-state-handling to define the
      expected loading UI, accessibility hooks, and telemetry. Document any open product questions in the
      clarifications evidence file.

      - Evidence lists chosen copy/testIDs, references standards/frontend-tier.md#async-state-handling, and

    title: Implement loading sentinel and telemetry
    details: >-
      Update CameraWithOverlay to render a lightweight placeholder (text + optional spinner) until
      `featureFlags` are resolved, ensuring it is accessible via `accessibilityRole="progressbar"` or similar
      per standards/mobile-tier.md#accessibility. Emit a `console.info` or analytics hook when the sentinel
      dismisses so tests and logs can assert readiness.

    outputs:
      - mobile/src/features/camera/CameraWithOverlay.tsx
      - mobile/src/features/camera/__tests__/CameraWithOverlay.test.tsx
    definition_of_done:
      - Component renders sentinel with deterministic testID, logs readiness transition, and tests assert both
        presence and disappearance using `findByTestId` per standards/testing-standards.md#react-component-testing.

    title: Validate UX and test evidence
    details: >-
      Run the mobile lint/static/test pipelines and capture screenshots or logs showing the sentinel output in
      storybook or Jest snapshots. Ensure acceptance criteria reference coverage expectations from
      standards/testing-standards.md#coverage-expectations.

    definition_of_done:
      - Validation doc links to command output, includes screenshot/log references, and states coverage results.
    estimate: S
    expected_files_touched:
      - docs/evidence/tasks/TASK-0918-validation.md

validation:
  pipeline:
    - command: pnpm turbo run lint:fix --filter=photoeditor-mobile
      description: Auto-fix linting issues before validation.
    - command: pnpm turbo run qa:static --filter=photoeditor-mobile
      description: Typecheck + lint to ensure the sentinel complies with standards/testing-standards.md.
    - command: pnpm turbo run test --filter=photoeditor-mobile
      description: Verify updated CameraWithOverlay tests covering the loading sentinel.
  manual_checks:
    - Capture a screenshot or storybook snippet of the loading sentinel for docs/evidence/tasks/TASK-0918-validation.md.

acceptance_criteria:
  must:
    - CameraWithOverlay renders an accessible loading sentinel with deterministic testID/text until
      `featureFlags` are populated.
    - Tests wait for the sentinel to disappear before asserting camera rendering, eliminating timing races.
    - Console/info telemetry logs both entry and exit of the sentinel state for debugging.
  quality_gates:
    - No regressions to frame processor enablement logic (feature flag guard remains unchanged outside the
      sentinel addition).
    - Coverage for the updated specs remains ≥70% lines / ≥60% branches per standards/testing-standards.md.

artifacts:
  - path: docs/evidence/tasks/TASK-0918-validation.md
    description: Validation commands and screenshot references proving the sentinel works as intended.

deliverables:
  - mobile/src/features/camera/CameraWithOverlay.tsx
  - mobile/src/features/camera/__tests__/CameraWithOverlay.test.tsx
  - docs/evidence/tasks/TASK-0918-validation.md

risks:
  - description: The loading sentinel may add perceivable latency if it persists longer than necessary on fast devices.
    mitigation: Keep the sentinel lightweight, dismiss immediately after feature flags resolve, and monitor logs for dwell time.
